# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this module I believe was to show us how to gather tables and graphs based on data that is being given. By using excel we can extract data into a visualization method that can be presented and be given a clear view of what stockholders or investors can see over a period of time. In Louise’s data we can see how outcomes are affected by their launch dates and their goals. We can also make relative facts based on the visual data presented and how to aproach theater luanch dates, as well as outcomes based on "play" goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

-- The Theater Outcomes Based by Launch Date show what months of the year theater outcomes are more successful and are more likely to fail. Theater successes have a greater achievement in the months of April through July. It also shows that within the same periods of months theaters are also likley to fail. There is also a sharp increase in failed theaters in the months of October and November.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

--The screenshots below from Louise’s play Fever show the results of the “Outcomes based on goals” and “Theater Outcomes by Launch Date”. The results show Outcomes Based on Goals are more successful if there goal ranges from 10,000 and less. It also indicates that Outcomes have astonishing chance of failure if their goals are between 20,000 and 30,000, as well as 45,000 and greater.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered  

--The challenges and difficulties were numerous to begin with. One of the biggest challenges I faced was creating the formulas for the Outcomes based on Goals. While it took a tremendous amount of time to test the formulas to make sure they work, I did not know that I was missing half of my data for the Kickstarter. I had to redownload the data and find out what went wrong, as well as trying to remove any filters that I had previously worked on.  By double checking my work and making sure that my results looked identical to module images I knew that I overcame my difficulties and was on the right path.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
-- They are two conclusions that can be drawn from the Theater Outcomes by launch date. The first conclusion that can be drawn from the Theater Outcomes is that theaters are more successful in the middle of the year than the beginning and end of the year. My logic reason is that the middle of the year tends to be summer, and more people are willing to go see live performances and the weather tends to be more favorable for a lot of people during the summers. The second conclusion is that while theaters are more successful, they also tend to have a 58% chance of failing during the same period. They also have a relative higher chance of failing during the months of October and November.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
--One conclusion that the Outcomes Based on Goals show is that outcomes goals of less than 10,000 are less have a greater chance of having a successful outcome. There is also a very high chance of failure for outcomes based on the goals of 20,000 and 35,000, as well as goals of 45,000 or greater. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
--They are some limitations of the data set that I believe are present for Outcomes based on Goals are questions. The one question that I would try to find out are what are main causes that is contributing to outcomes having a very high chance of failure when their goals reach a certain number? There are also limitations on what particular group for example gender or age that go to theater or plays. 

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
--For the Theater Outcomes I would certainly try to add more tables and graphs explaining the contributing factors for theater success as well as factors contributing to their failures. For Outcomes based on goals I would recommend more detailed approach on what kind of plays are more successful for example what kind of performances? Are they live? Classicals? Or more modern plays for entertainment or kid cartoon plays.
